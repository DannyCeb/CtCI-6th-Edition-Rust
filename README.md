## Solving *Cracking the Coding Interview* Challenges in Rust

This project involves solving the challenges from the book *Cracking the Coding Interview* using the Rust programming language.

*Cracking the Coding Interview* is a comprehensive resource for preparing for technical interviews, offering a wide range of algorithmic and data structure problems. Rust, with its focus on performance, memory safety, and concurrency, is well-suited for implementing efficient and robust solutions to these challenges.

By utilizing Rust, this project aims to demonstrate best practices in systems programming while applying core computer science concepts to solve complex problems.
